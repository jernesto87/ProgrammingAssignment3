# Codebook based on customizations made to the requested dataset


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. 
These time domain signals [Time] were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz, filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration [Gravity] signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signal [Jerk]. 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm [Magnitude]. 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform was applied to some of these signals producing [Frequency]. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals.
